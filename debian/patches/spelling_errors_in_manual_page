 However, TeX\(cqs main source for font descriptions is Metafont, which produces bitmap output (GF files)\&. That\(cqs why not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in a scalable format\&. In these cases, dvisvgm tries to vectorize Metafont\(cqs output by tracing the glyph bitmaps\&. The results are not as perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB or OTF counterparts, but are nonetheless really nice in most cases\&.

 dvisvgm provides a POSIX\-compliant command\-line interface with short and long option names\&. They may be given before and/or after the name of the file to be converted\&. Also, the order of specifying the options is not significant, i\&.e\&. you can add them in any order without changing dvisvgm\(cqs behavior\&. Certain options accept or require additional parameters which are directly appended to or separated by whitespace from a short option (e\&.g\&. \fB\-v0\fR or \fB\-v 0\fR)\&. Long options require an additional equals sign (\fB=\fR) between option name and argument but without any surrounding whitespace (e\&.g\&. \fB\-\-verbosity=0\fR)\&. Multiple short options that don\(cqt expect a further parameter can be combined after a single dash (e\&.g\&. \fB\-ejs\fR rather than \fB\-e \-j \-s\fR)\&.
