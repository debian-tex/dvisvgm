dvisvgm (2.13.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  A note from upstream:

  Ghostscript has introduced a completely rewritten implementation of its PDF
  interpreter, which is now implemented in C instead of PostScript. This has a
  lot of advantages besides the performance improvements. For third-party
  applications like dvisvgm, however, this change has significant impact on
  the functions that can be provided. dvisvgm relies on the possibility to
  overwrite PostScript and PDF operators in order to directly communicate with
  the interpreter. The nice thing about the current PostScript-based PDF
  interpreter is the fact that both PostScript and PDF code can be treated
  almost equally.
  As of Ghostscript 9.56.0, this will no longer be possible, and as far as I
  can tell from the documentation, there is no way to replicate the current
  functionality. As a consequence, all PDF functionality currently available
  in dvisvgm will no longer work with the upcoming Ghostscript releases.
  Therefore, it will require the parallel installation of Ghostscript 9.55.0 or
  earlier. In the long run, I’ll probably have to drop PDF support since I
  don’t have the resources to implement a completely new PDF handler.
